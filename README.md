# Conduit - The MCP Server for Phabricator and Phorge
Conduit is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that provides seamless integration with Phabricator and Phorge APIs, enabling advanced automation and interaction capabilities for developers and tools.

## Conduit
**Modern HTTP Client**: Built with `httpx` for HTTP/2 support and better performance

**MCP Integration**: Ready-to-use MCP tools for task management

**Type Safety**: Full type hints for better development experience

**Secure**: Token-based authentication with environment variable configuration

## Usage
### Via `uvx`
You need to install `uv` first. If it is not installed, run the following command:
```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
After installation, restart your shell or terminal to apply the environment variable changes.

Then run:
```sh
uvx --from git+https://github.com/mcpnow-io/conduit conduit-mcp
```

### From Source
To install from source for development or contribution:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mcpnow-io/conduit.git
cd conduit

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This will install the package in editable mode with all development dependencies.

### Docker
We are still working on Docker support. We estimate it will be available soon.

### As HTTP/SSE Server
Conduit can run as an HTTP/SSE server for multi-user scenarios. This mode allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously, each using their own authentication tokens.

```sh
conduit-mcp --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
When running as an HTTP server, authentication tokens are provided via HTTP headers instead of environment variables.

```
X-PHABRICATOR-TOKEN: your-32-character-token-here
```

## Configuration
Before running the server, you need to set up the following environment variables:

### Environment Variables
```sh
export PHABRICATOR_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
export PHABRICATOR_URL="https://your-phabricator-instance.com/api/"

export PHABRICATOR_PROXY="socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"  # Optional, if your network is behind a firewall
export PHABRICATOR_DISABLE_CERT_VERIFY=1  # Optional, if your network is under HTTPS filter (WARNING: Disabling certificate verification can expose you to security risks. Only set this if you trust your network environment.)
```
Do note that in HTTPS/SSE mode, `PHABRICATOR_TOKEN` is NOT needed.

### Getting Your API Token
1. Log into your Phabricator instance
2. Go to Settings > API Tokens
3. Generate a new token
4. Copy the 32-character token and use it as `PHABRICATOR_TOKEN`

### Development Setup
This project uses modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml` for dependency management and build configuration. To set up for development:

1. Install the package in editable mode with development dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

2. Run pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:
   ```sh
   pre-commit run -a
   ```

3. Run tests with coverage:
   ```sh
   coverage run -m pytest -s
   ```
