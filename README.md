# Conduit - The MCP Server for Phabricator and Phorge
Conduit is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that provides seamless integration with Phabricator and Phorge APIs, enabling advanced automation and interaction capabilities for developers and tools.

## Conduit
**Modern HTTP Client**: Built with `httpx` for HTTP/2 support and better performance

**Sync & Async**: Both synchronous and asynchronous API clients

**MCP Integration**: Ready-to-use MCP tools for task management

**Type Safety**: Full type hints for better development experience

**Secure**: Token-based authentication with environment variable configuration

## Usage
### Via `uvx`
You need to install `uv` first. If it is not installed, run the following command:
```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
After installation, restart your shell or terminal to apply the environment variable changes.

Then run:
```sh
uvx --from git+https://github.com/mcpnow-io/conduit conduit-mcp
```

### Docker
We are still working on Docker support. We estimate it will be available soon.

## Configuration
Before running the server, you need to set up the following environment variables:

### Environment Variables

```bash
export PHABRICATOR_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
export PHABRICATOR_URL="https://your-phabricator-instance.com/api/"

export PHABRICATOR_PROXY="socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"  # Optional, if your network is behind a firewall
export PHABRICATOR_DISABLE_CERT_VERIFY=1  # Optional, if your network is under HTTPS filter (WARNING: Disabling certificate verification can expose you to security risks. Only set this if you trust your network environment.)
```

### Getting Your API Token
1. Log into your Phabricator instance
2. Go to Settings > API Tokens
3. Generate a new token
4. Copy the 32-character token and use it as `PHABRICATOR_TOKEN`
